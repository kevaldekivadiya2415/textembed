                                           If not provided, it is derived from the last two segments of the model path.
        trust_remote_code (bool): Whether to trust remote code.
        workers (int): The number of worker tasks to process requests. Defaults to the number of CPU cores.
        batch_size (int): The maximum number of requests to process in a single batch.
                          Must be greater than or equal to 1.
