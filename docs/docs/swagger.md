# Swagger UI Documentation

## Overview

This document provides information about accessing the Swagger UI for the TextEmbed API. Swagger UI is a tool that allows you to interact with and test the API endpoints directly from your browser. 

## Accessing Swagger UI

**Disclaimer**: The Swagger UI you access may differ from the documentation provided in this release, as it is based on the current main branch of the codebase.

### Swagger UI URL

You can view the Swagger UI and interact with the API documentation at:

- **Local Deployment**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
  
  Replace `8000` with the port number you have configured for your TextEmbed server.

## API Documentation

The Swagger UI provides an interactive view of all available API endpoints, including:

- **Endpoints**: List of available API endpoints with descriptions.
- **Request Parameters**: Details on required and optional parameters for each endpoint.
- **Response Formats**: Expected responses and error messages for each API call.
- **Try it Out**: Ability to send test requests directly from the Swagger UI.

## Access Instructions

1. **Start the TextEmbed Server**: Ensure your TextEmbed server is running locally or use the provided test deployment.

2. **Open Swagger UI**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` (adjust the port number if needed) in your web browser.

3. **Explore the API**: Use the Swagger UI to explore and interact with the API endpoints. You can send test requests, view responses, and understand the APIâ€™s functionality directly from the UI.

## Notes

- The Swagger UI reflects the latest changes from the main branch and may not always match the release version of the API.
- For questions or issues, refer to the [TextEmbed documentation](https://github.com/kevaldekivadiya2415/textembed/blob/main/docs/setup.md) or open an issue on the GitHub repository.

Feel free to explore the API and test out various endpoints using the interactive features of Swagger UI.
