# **Swagger UI Documentation**

## 📖 **Overview**

This guide provides instructions for accessing and using the Swagger UI for the **TextEmbed API**. Swagger UI is a user-friendly interface that allows you to interact with and test the API endpoints directly from your browser.

## 🌐 **Accessing Swagger UI**

> **Note**: The Swagger UI you access may reflect the most recent changes from the `main` branch, which may differ from this release’s documentation.

### 🔗 **Swagger UI URL**

To view the Swagger UI and interact with the API documentation, go to:

- **Local Deployment**: [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs)

  *(Replace `8000` with the port number you have configured for your TextEmbed server.)*

## 📝 **API Documentation Overview**

Swagger UI provides an interactive view of all available API endpoints, including:

- **🔍 Endpoints**: Lists all API endpoints with their descriptions.
- **📥 Request Parameters**: Detailed information on required and optional parameters for each endpoint.
- **📤 Response Formats**: Displays the expected responses and possible error messages for each API call.
- **🛠️ Try it Out**: Allows you to send test requests directly from the Swagger UI.

## 🛠️ **Access Instructions**

1. **Start the TextEmbed Server**: Ensure your TextEmbed server is running locally or using the provided test deployment.

2. **Open Swagger UI**: In your web browser, navigate to [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs) (adjust the port number if needed).

3. **Explore the API**: Use the Swagger UI to explore the API endpoints, send test requests, view responses, and gain a deeper understanding of the API's functionality.

## ⚠️ **Notes**

- The Swagger UI reflects the latest updates from the `main` branch and may not always match the current release version of the API.
